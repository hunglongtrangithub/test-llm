CLINICAL HISTORY:
Patient is a 69 year old post-menopausal female presenting for evaluation of a left breast lump and enlarged left axillary lymph node identified on routine screening mammography performed on 8/8/10. 

MAMMOGRAPHY:
Digital diagnostic mammography of the left breast was performed. Full lateral inferior and magnification views confirm the presence of a 1.0 cm ill-defined mass at the 4 o’clock position of the left breast. A left axillary view shows 2 abnormal dense round lymph nodes measuring 3.0 cm and 2.1 cm.
Sonography of the left breast confirms a 1.0x0.8x0.7 cm hypoechoic mass at the 4 o’clock central position. This mass has an irregular shape and no other masses are seen.
Sonography of the left axilla demonstrates 2 abnormal lymph nodes, both with cortical thickening. This is worrisome for extra-nodal extension and favors a diagnosis of metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION:
There is a suspicious 1.0 cm solid mass located in the left breast at 4 o’clock. There are 2 palpable enlarged left axillary lymph nodes. Ultrasound guided core biopsy the left breast mass is recommended. Ultrasound guided core biopsy of the abnormal left axillary lymph node was recommended.
ACR BI-RADS category (left breast): 5 – Highly suggestive of malignancy.
Abnormal left axillary lymph node highly suspicious for metastatic disease.
