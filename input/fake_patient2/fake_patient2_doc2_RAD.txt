CLINICAL HISTORY:
51 year old peri-menopausal female who presents with a new hard palpable lump in the left breast.
TECHNIQUE:
Full field digital mammography with CAD was performed including routine views of both breasts, spot magnification views on the right with a full 90 degree lateral and spot compression views on the left.
Left breast and axillary ultrasound was performed.
FINDINGS:
Heterogeneously dense fibro glandular tissue is present throughout both breasts limiting the sensitivity of the mammogram.  There is no evidence of mass or calcifications in the right breast.
A large firm mass is seen in the upper outer left breast at the 2 o’clock region.  The mass measures 1x2 cm on the CC view.  Calcifications are seen adjacent to the mass.
Ultrasound evaluation was performed on the area and a 1.3x3.2x5.1 cm hypoechoic mass is seen in the left breast at the 2 o’clock region.
Ultrasound of the left axillary lymph nodes was performed revealing multiple abnormally thickened lymph nodes.  The largest lymph node has a thickened cortex of at least 6 mm.
IMPRESSION:	
A large hypoechoic mass at the 2 o’clock location of the left breast is highly suggestive of a malignancy.  The mass measures 1.3x3.2x5.1 cm.  Ultrasound core biopsy is recommended.
Abnormal left axillary lymph nodes are highly suspicious of metastatic disease.
MR evaluation of extent of disease is recommended.
ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
ACR BI-RADS Category: 5 (Breast Imaging Left) Highly suggestive for malignancy.
RECOMMENDATION: Ultrasound guided core biopsy
OVERALL ASSESSMENT: 5 (Highly suggestive for malignancy.
