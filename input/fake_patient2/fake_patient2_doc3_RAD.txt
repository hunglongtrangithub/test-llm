CLINICAL HISTORY:
51 year old peri-menopausal female who presents with a new hard palpable lump in the left breast.  Patient is here for ultrasound guided core biopsy.
PROCEDURE TITLE:
Targeted ultrasound left breast.
Ultrasound guided core biopsy of left 2 o’clock abnormality.
Clip placement.
Ultrasound guided core biopsy of left axillary abnormal lymph node.
Clip placement.
Post procedure left breast mammogram.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:
The left breast and axilla were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  First the left 2 o’clock position 5 cm from the nipple was targeted.  Local anesthesia was obtained with 2% xylocaine.  A small skin incision was made.  Under ultrasound guidance from a medial approach, 2 passes with a 14 gauge biopsy device were performed and sent to pathology.  A wing clip was placed at the 2 o’clock position 5 cm from the nipple under ultrasound guidance.
Then attention was turned to the left abnormal axillary lymph node.  Local anesthesia was obtained with 2% xylocaine.  A small skin incision was made.  Under ultrasound guidance from an inferomedial approach, 2 passes with a 14 gauge biopsy device were performed and sent to pathology.  A coil clip was placed at the site of the biopsy.
The wounds were cleaned and dressed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications.
Post procedure mammogram of the left breast demonstrated adequate clip placement.
IMPRESSION:
Uncomplicated ultrasound guided core biopsies of the left breast at the 2 o’clock position and abnormal left axillary lymph node.
