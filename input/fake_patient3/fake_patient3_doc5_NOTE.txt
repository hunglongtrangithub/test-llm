Reason for Visit:  Post op right axillary lymph node dissection.

Diagnosis: Stage II (T2, N1, M0) right invasive ductal breast carcinoma with metastatic disease to the right axillary lymph nodes:  ER positive, PR positive, and Her2 negative.

Procedure: Right axillary lymph node dissection on March 1, 2010. 

Interim History: The patient is a 44 year old female who presents for her postoperative visit following axillary lymph node dissection for metastatic breast cancer. The procedure was performed without complication and her recovery has been uneventful.

PMH: Her past medical history is significant for diagnosis of breast cancer in 2001 when she found a lump in her left breast during self-exam.  At that time she had a biopsy done and had stage 2B adenocarcinoma.  She underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and then had a left mastectomy followed by XRT.  

Physical Exam: The patient’s physical examination demonstrates a healing axillary wound.  There is no erythema, swelling, redness or edema. No signs of bruising and no infection are noted. She denies any fever or pain. 

Impression: A 44 year old female with stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast, treated with a right segmental mastectomy and right axillary lymph node dissection.

Recommendations:  The patient’s surgical management is now complete.  She has a Medical Oncology consult 3/25/10, to discuss systemic therapies as indicated. Radiation Oncology consult to follow, to discuss required adjuvant breast irradiation.
