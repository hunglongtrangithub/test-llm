DIAGNOSIS:  Stage II (T2 N1 M0) invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast, metastatic to right axillary lymph nodes. ER positive, PR positive, Her2 negative.

REASON FOR VISIT:  Discuss chemotherapy.

Patient returns to the office today for management of invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast with axillary lymph node metastasis.
Her initial office visit was on January 16, 2010.

I discussed treatment options with her and her husband. I recommended chemotherapy with Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel. She will come in next week to start this regimen.

PMH: Her past medical history is significant for diagnosis of breast cancer in 2001 when she found a lump in her left breast during self-exam.  At that time she had a biopsy done and had stage 2B adenocarcinoma.  She underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and then had a left mastectomy followed by XRT.  

Physical Exam: The patientâ€™s physical examination demonstrates a healing axillary wound.  There is no erythema, swelling, redness or edema. No signs of bruising and no infection are noted. She denies any fever or pain. 

IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 44 year-old female with stage 2, invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast s/p right segmental mastectomy followed by right axillary lymph node dissection for metastatic disease. She will receive 4 cycles of Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel. We will monitor her for any side effects and will re-assess her response after the 4th cycle.
