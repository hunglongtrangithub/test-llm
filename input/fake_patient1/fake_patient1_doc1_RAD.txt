CLINICAL HISTORY:
This is a 50 year old peri-menopausal female who underwent mammogram on 1/28/09 for a palpable lump in the right breast. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.2x3.4x5.6 cm hypoechoic mass in the upper inner quadrant at the 1 0’clock position. Ultrasonography also revealed an abnormally thickened lymph node in the right axilla which had a thickened cortex of 7 mm.  She now presents for U/S guided core biopsy of the mass and the abnormal lymph node.
PROCEDURE: 
Ultrasound guided core biopsy of right breast 1 o’clock abnormality with clip placement
Ultrasound guided core biopsy of right axilla abnormal lymph node with clip placement

FINDINGS:
The right breast and axilla were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  First the right 1 o’clock position 5 cm from the nipple was targeted.  Local anesthesia was obtained with 2% xylocaine.  A small skin incision was made.  Under ultrasound guidance from a medial approach, 2 passes with a 14 gauge biopsy device were performed and sent to pathology.  A clip was placed. 
Then attention was turned to the right abnormal axillary lymph node.  Local anesthesia was obtained with 2% xylocaine.  A small skin incision was made.  Under ultrasound guidance from an inferomedial approach, 2 passes with a 14 gauge biopsy device were performed and sent to pathology.  A  clip was placed at the site of the biopsy.
The wounds were cleaned and dressed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications.
Post procedure mammogram of the right breast demonstrated adequate clip placement.
IMPRESSION:
Uncomplicated ultrasound guided core biopsies of the right breast at the 1 o’clock position and abnormal right axillary lymph node.
